Lallu, the crocodile was bored. He was looking for friends to play with. He found none.
Then, he spotted an elephant wading into a stream. “Ah, it will be fun to pull him into the water,” Lallu thought.

It was hot. Gajju, the elephant wanted to splash water on his back. He sucked water into his trunk and poured it
 down over his back. ‘Ah, it’s so cool,” he thought to himself.

 Just then, he felt somebody pulling his leg. He tried to take his leg back. He could not move it.
